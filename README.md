# .emacs

# What is it?
I'm a web developer specialized in frontend. But, usually, I work backend too. So, my `.emacs` is focused on _HTML_, _JavaScript_, _CSS_ (_SCSS_) & Backend with _Django_ (_python_) or _Rails_ (_ruby_)


Here you can find my `.emacs` (or `.emacs.d/init.el`) & its structure folder. Plus, you will find each element to insall and a link to it. So, you can check and add whatever you want to your .emcas.

The idea of this repo is to can share with some friends and with myself, and who feel it could help can use it and continue the `Emac Path`
Feel free to use & share. It repository will be constantly updated.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure of my `.emacs.d/` folder is:

``` sh
